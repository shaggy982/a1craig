					<h2>Big 5 Test</h2>
					<b>Openness to Experience – Medium Characteristics</b>
					<p>
					You have a medium level of openness to experience. At times, you can be very creative, curious, and adventurous.
					At other times, you prefer routine. You are able to find a great balance between ideas and practicality.<br>
					You typically are a good problem-solver. When you are faced with a problem, you consider the tried-and true methods,
					but are also able to think outside the box. You are able to handle whatever life throws at you.<br>
					People who are moderate in openness to experience are well-suited for careers that balance creativity with stability 
					– for example, journalism, photography, graphic design, or research.<br>
					</p>
					<b>Extraversion – Medium Characteristics</b>
					<p>
					You have a medium level of extraversion. This means that at times, you get your energy from being around others; but 
					at other times, you get your energy by being alone. Life is all about balance, and for you, it’s important to spend 
					time alone and with others. You don’t mind being the centre of attention at times, but you don’t seek out ways to be
					the centre of attention either.<br>
					Because you have traits of both an introvert and extravert, you know when to speak up and when to stay silent. You are 
					able to recognize the times when you need to speak up and be assertive, and can find the courage to have those difficult
					conversations when necessary.<br>
					Jobs for those who are moderately extraverted include those that allow building relationships with others, but also allow
					periods of time to work alone. The best jobs for these individuals include counselling, human resources, or being a director.<br>
					</p>
					<b>Neuroticism – Low Characteristics</b>
					<p>
					You scored low in neuroticism. You are very emotionally stable. While others may experience emotions of extreme highs and 
					extreme lows, you tend to stay somewhere in the middle. Others often describe you as calm, level-headed, and optimistic.
					Because of your tendency to tend to “go with the flow” in life, you have a hard time understanding people who are extremely 
					emotional or anxious. Those who score low in neuroticism have a difficult time understanding and spending time with people 
					who are highly neurotic. You typically prefer spending time with people who are relaxed, like yourself.<br>
					In stressful situations, you are able to remain calm and think clearly. Others typically look to you for guidance when this
					occurs, and in many situations, you are a natural leader.<br>
					Because those who score low in neuroticism are so level-headed, they tend to do well in leadership roles. They typically make
					great managers and executives.

					<h2>Online Lerning Styles Test</h2>
						<p>
							What's Your Learning Style? The Results<br>
							<br>
							<b>scores:</b><br>
							Auditory: 50%<br>
							Visual: 30%<br>
							Tactile: 20%<br>
							You are an Auditory learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.<br>
							<br>
							<b>Auditory</b><br>
							<br>
							If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store
							information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn
							by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.<br>
							As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying
							attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.<br>
							Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.
							Sit where you can hear.
							Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.
							Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud.
							Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.
							Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.
							Have test questions read to you out loud.
							Study new material by reading it out loud.
							Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, in order to learn well<br>

						<h3>What do you think these test results mean for you?</h3>
					<p>
					I feel that these test results speak to me about who I feel I am as a person. These tests took into consideration on who I am,
					and I feel that they are true and correct. And it means that I think like some of the top leaders of this world. I am glad I 
					took these tests because it answered a lot of questions I had about myself.
					</p>
					<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
					<p>
					I do not think that these results will change anything about the way I behave in a team. it is how I have always behaved when
					involved in any team activity, I have always taken a leadership roll when needed and I have always followed the leader when I 
					am a team member. I have always done well as a team leader. I normally have ended up advancing to a leadership role in most of 
					my jobs and I take it very seriously.
					</p>
					<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
					<p>
					I will look for like-minded team members. members I can get along with, members that like to have a laugh but can also take
					things seriously. Members that can get in and get things done when needed without needing to be guided all the way but can also
					communicate well with a team and can work well in a team.

		<h2>JAVA BASED SIP SOFTPHONE WITH FULL FEATURES</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="leftcolumn">
				<h3>Overview:</h3>
					<p>
					My Project Idea is a Java Based Softphone that support SIP.<br>
					Based on the Java Coding language it will also Contain XML functions linking<br>
					into external applications. Used for sending and receiving Voice, and TXT<br>
					based messaging. It will be a fully featured softphone supporting Caller ID,<br>
					call parking, multi lines, call forward, call transfer, Call waiting, and<br>
					usable on Windows, Mac and all distros of Linux desktop.<br>
					</p>
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>
					My motivation for this if stemming from my frustration with the current market<br>
					for IP Phones, you either must buy expensive hardware to get full functionality<br>
					from an expensive IP Phone. Or you must download a free softphone app and then<br>
					pay for all the features offered by the software provider. My App with be cost<br>
					effective and allow full connectivity to a free PBX management system like FreePBX.<br>
					The current free/low cost softphones on the market does not support most of the<br>
					features of a PBX System.<br>
					</p>
				<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>
					My App will include the following features:<br>
					Call Parking/hold, Call forwarding, Call Transfer, Caller ID, Conference calling,
					Multi Line support, Multi Extension support<br>
					It will be based on Java coding but will also include XML scripts, HTML, CSS, and
					support for multiple audio output links (I.E headset for calls, Speakers for ringer
					and speakerphone). <br>
					Support for an operator panel similar to what you would find on a reception desk
					a The user will be able to use this softphone like a Cisco IP phone	and use all the
					features you would expect from a commercial grade IP phone. Furthermore, as it will 
 				    be using SIP technology you will be able to skip the PBX server and connect	directly
					to a VoIP Provider. Building an app like this will hopefully break the hold	that major
					companies have on the end users. In the future this could also be converted into a 
					better looking full featured software application using C++ or another programming
					language.<br>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="rightcolumn">
					<h3>Tools and Technologies required</h3>
					<p>
					Java Programming knowledge will be required along with knowledge of XML, HTML, CSS,
					Networking, Communication technology (SIP-VoIP) and Hardware knowledge. Possibly a
					knowledge of another programming language (I.E C++ or Python) could be required A 
					knowledge of Eclipse IDE will be required. No actual physical tool will be required
					to build this project as it will be 100% programming knowledge however a FreePBX server
					or a VoIP account with a service provider will be required for testing and use.
					</p>
					<h3>Skills Required</h3>
					<p>
					To build this application I will need to have an extensive knowledge of the JAVA Programming
					language, An extensive knowledge of XML, a decent knowledge of HTML and CSS, An extensive
					knowledge of hardware and networking. And possibly some Other Programming language, for example
					C++ or Python. I will need to know how to link hardware functions into JAVA for example connection
					to the network and the internet and connecting to multiple audio devices and routing the correct
					channel of audio to the correct device.<br>
					</p>
					<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>
					I believe that this project could be successful and if it is, it could open the market for full
					featured communications to the small/medium sized businesses and home end users at a reasonable
					and affordable price. It will solve the problem by eliminating the need for small/medium sized
					business and home users to use a phone system that is basic. And will provided them with the same
					features that only Medium/large businesses can normally afford, Giving small businesses a professional
					enterprise level phone system.
