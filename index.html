						<b>When did your intrest in IT start?</b><br>
						<br>
						It started when I was 14 after my parents bought our first PC and I thought it would be a good idea to see what was inside and then I coldn't get it to work again.<br>

					<p>
						<b>Was there a Particular event that sparked your intrest?</b><br>
						<br>
						Yes when I pulled apart out first PC and couldn't get it to work again. So my parents took my to the local PC shop where I was taken into the workshop and shown how to build a system. and it has gone on from there.<br>
