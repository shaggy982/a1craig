	<h2>JAVA BASED SIP SOFTPHONE WITH FULL FEATURES</h2>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>
My Project Idea is a Java Based Softphone that support SIP.<br>
Based on the Java Coding language it will also Contain XML functions linking<br>
into external applications. Used for sending and receiving Voice, and TXT<br>
based messaging. It will be a fully featured softphone supporting Caller ID,<br>
call parking, multi lines, call forward, call transfer, Call waiting, and<br>
usable on Windows, Mac and all distros of Linux desktop.<br>
</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
My motivation for this if stemming from my frustration with the current market<br>
for IP Phones, you either must buy expensive hardware to get full functionality<br>
from an expensive IP Phone. Or you must download a free softphone app and then<br>
pay for all the features offered by the software provider. My App with be cost<br>
effective and allow full connectivity to a free PBX management system like FreePBX.<br>
The current free/low cost softphones on the market does not support most of the<br>
features of a PBX System.<br>
</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
My App will include the following features:<br>
•	Call Parking/hold<br>
•	Call forwarding<br>
•	Call Transfer<br>
•	Caller ID<br>
•	Conference calling<br>
•	Multi Line support<br>
•	Multi Extension support<br>
It will be based on Java coding but will also include XML scripts, HTML, CSS, and<br>
support for multiple audio output links (I.E headset for calls, Speakers for ringer<br>
and speakerphone). The user will be able to use this softphone like a Cisco IP phone<br>
and use all the features you would expect from a commercial grade IP phone. Furthermore,<br>
as it will be using SIP technology you will be able to skip the PBX server and connect<br>
directly to a VoIP Provider. Building an app like this will hopefully break the hold<br>
that major companies have on the end users. In the future this could also be converted<br>
into a better looking full featured software application using C++ or another programming<br>
language.<br>
</p>
<h3>Tools and Technologies required</h3>
<p>
Java Programming knowledge will be required along with knowledge of XML, HTML, CSS,<br>
Networking, Communication technology (SIP-VoIP) and Hardware knowledge. Possibly a<br>
knowledge of another programming language (I.E C++ or Python) could be required A <br>
knowledge of Eclipse IDE will be required. No actual physical tool will be required<br>
to build this project as it will be 100% programming knowledge however a FreePBX server<br>
or a VoIP account with a service provider will be required for testing and use.<br>
</p>
<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>
To build this application I will need to have an extensive knowledge of the JAVA Programming<br>
language, An extensive knowledge of XML, a decent knowledge of HTML and CSS, An extensive<br>
knowledge of hardware and networking. And possibly some Other Programming language, for example<br>
C++ or Python. I will need to know how to link hardware functions into JAVA for example connection<br>
to the network and the internet and connecting to multiple audio devices and routing the correct<br>
channel of audio to the correct device.<br>
</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
I believe that this project could be successful and if it is, it could open the market for full<br>
featured communications to the small/medium sized businesses and home end users at a reasonable<br>
and affordable price. It will solve the problem by eliminating the need for small/medium sized<br>
business and home users to use a phone system that is basic. And will provided them with the same<br>
features that only Medium/large businesses can normally afford, Giving small businesses a professional<br>
enterprise level phone system.<br>
